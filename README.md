# LangGraph-Agent

LangGraph-Agent is a Python-based project designed to demonstrate agent-based workflows using LangGraph. It provides a simple framework for building, running, and experimenting with language model agents in a graph-like structure.

## Features
- Agent-based workflow orchestration
- Integration with LangGraph for graph-based execution
- Easy configuration via `.env` file
- Extensible for custom agent logic

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/pachumon/LangGraph-Agent.git
   cd LangGraph-Agent
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration
- Create a `.env` file in the project root to store environment variables (API keys, settings, etc.).
- Example `.env`:
  ```env
  LANGGRAPH_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  AGENT_CONFIG=default
  ```

## Usage

Run the main application:
```powershell
python langgraph_app.py
```
